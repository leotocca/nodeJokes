# nodeJokes

A simple CLI app done with node.js

- Download the files and run "node index.js".

- You'll get asked for a keyword to request the icanhazdadjokes.com API. Then, a random joke that got received from the API will be logged in the CLI.

- The jokes will also be stored in a joke.txt file

- If you input the keyword "leaderboard" you'll get the most repeated joke in joke.txt
